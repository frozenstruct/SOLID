# SOLID Exploration

**xcodebuild / xcodetest:** \
[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/93afd40bad34c60b/status.svg?token=KyoWMRIe7mkgm3uaZnMD6g&branch=main)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/93afd40bad34c60b)

**Goal:** \
Implement SOLID principles on simple entities:
- **S**: see `SRP` folder
- **O**: see `OCP` folder
- **L**: see `LSP` folder
- **I**: see `ISP` folder
- **D**: see `LSP` folder, `UserManager.swift`, line 16

**Side Note:** \
Unit-Testing via `XCTest` (passing, see Bitrise) is limited due to questionable relevancy here.
Some tests are although implemented in puirsuit of playing with mocks and expectations.
